# WindowsSetup
Simple powershell script that automates my setup process on a new windows system. 

This script configures Windows to a minimal, distraction-free state by adjusting default settings, including:
- Disabling notifications and tips
- Turning off Focus Assist and automatic quiet hours
- Customizing Taskbar and Start Menu appearance
- Setting power and sleep options for convenience
- Disabling unnecessary system icons and background features
- Applying a custom dark accent color
- Optimizing privacy and shared experience settings

Run this script right after a fresh Windows install to quickly apply these baseline preferences and streamline your environment.
(Admin permissions may be needed as this affects system settings)
(Created and tested on Windows 10 Pro v22H2)
